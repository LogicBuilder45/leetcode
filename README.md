# 👋 Hi, I'm Saqib Khan

**Solution & Data Architect** focused on building and optimizing modern data platforms using **Snowflake, Airflow, and cloud-native ETL**.

I design end-to-end data solutions that are:
- **Reliable** – robust pipelines, clear data contracts
- **Efficient** – performance-tuned & cost-aware
- **Governed** – role-based access, security by design

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- **Architecture & Design**
  - Modern data warehouse & lakehouse architectures
  - Snowflake environment design (roles, warehouses, databases, cost model)
  - ETL/ELT patterns for batch & near real-time

- **Optimization & Performance**
  - Query tuning and micro-partition-aware modeling
  - Warehouse sizing and workload isolation
  - Cost governance frameworks for Snowflake

- **Data Engineering Platform Enablement**
  - Airflow-based orchestration
  - CI/CD for data (Snowflake, DBT-style workflows)
  - Standards, best practices, and playbooks for teams

---

## 🛠️ Tech Snapshot

- **Cloud / Data**
  - Snowflake, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse, Airflow
  - Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres
  - S3 / Blob storage, Parquet, Data lakes

- **Patterns & Practices**
  - Dimensional modeling, Data Vault style thinking
  - RBAC & least-privilege access in data platforms
  - Cost-optimized warehouse design

- **Tooling**
  - Azure DevOps (Pipelines & Repos), basic Git
  - Power BI, Excel (for analytics consumers)
